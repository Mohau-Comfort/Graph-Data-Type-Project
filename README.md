# Graph Data Type Project

## Note: The project was done was using Java and JavaFX frameworks.

**_This a java project I made illustrating how I can use blockchain distributions using the Graph ADT. It was for my Computer Science 3A module covering one of the concepts we learn for that module (Advanced Data Types and Alogorithms). This project was covering the Graph data type and it shows how blockchain can be used as supplychain. I used JavaFX for the graphics of my project._**
